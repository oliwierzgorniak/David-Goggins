            My favorite athlete is an American
            <strong>ultra-runner, ex-Navy-Seal,</strong> an authentic influencer

            is a brave <strong>advocate of challenging yourself</strong> to
            become a better, more disciplined person. His struggle in life led
            him to conclusions which for many are hard to practice – to become
            better you need to challenge your mind and go further than your body
            tells you. One of his discoveries is that when you feel like you are
            done with something you have only reached 40% of your potential.
            With his warrior mindset David Goggins accomplished outstanding
            challenges like:

        <p class="childhood__paragraph article-paragraph">
          David did not have an easy start to life. The atmosphere in his home
          was tough. David’s father – Trunnis was a corrupt person who
          <strong
            >forced his children to work in the nights during school days and
            beat them up</strong
          >. The violence was also addressed to <em>Jackie</em> Goggins –
          David's mother. The 8-year-boy lived in <em>constant</em> fear. The
          beat ups had a serious impact on Goggins mental health, because of
          them Goggins suffered trauma even in his adult life. One day his
          mother <strong>found enough courage to run away</strong> from his
          abusive partner.
        </p>
        <h3 class="childhood__subtitle section-subtitle">After the escape</h3>
        <p class="childhood__paragraph article-paragraph">
          Jackie Goggins and David moved to Brazil, Indiana. <em>Finally</em>,
          Goggins got rid of their huge problem – Trunnis, but life did not turn
          into a wonderland. They still had serious challenges. One of them was
          racism. Brazil was a small town with almost no black people.
          Americans' mentality back then was much different than today. Racism
          was a common phenomenon. The pinnacle of it was a situation in which
          <strong>a teenager pointed a <em>gun</em> at Goggins' head</strong>
          while he was walking down the road with his black friend.

          Educational struggles
        </h3>
        <p class="childhood__paragraph article-paragraph">
          The other David’s struggle was his situation at school.
          <strong>He was a slow learner.</strong> It took him much more to
          acquire material than other kids. He needed attention from others and
          should have put in a lot of work to keep up. Otherwise, he would have
          ended up in a special school which he described like that: “It was
          like a bad movie. The shrink set up seven chairs in a semicircle
          around him, but some of the kids wouldn’t or couldn’t sit still. One
          child wore a helmet and banged his head against the wall repeatedly.
          Another kid stood up while the doctor was mid-sentence, walked toward
          a far corner of the room, and peed in the trash can. The kid sitting
          next to me was the most normal person in the group, and he had set his
          own house on <em>fire</em>!”. To avoid such a place
          <strong
            >he chose cheating, which he practiced for a long time.</strong
          >
          This decision had adverse consequences on the man’s life.

          Transformation and military career
        </h2>
        <h3 class="transformation__subtitle section-subtitle">
          Time for change
        </h3>
        <p class="transformation__paragraph article-paragraph">
          As a young men David decided to join the Air Force inspired by his
          proud Grandfather who served there for 37 years being a cook. But
          there was an obstacle in his way. He failed to pass the ASVAB test,
          which is an equivalent of SATs (exam used for college admission in the
          US) for the military. David studying struggles and constant cheating
          led to the situation where he could not get 36 points out of
          <em>99</em> need to join the Air Force. The change was coming. Young
          David was in a desperate situation.
          <strong
            >He had bad grades at school, missed a lot of classes and had no
            future.</strong
          >
          That day Goggins, in front of a mirror, gave himself a self-motivation
          talk and
          <strong
            >decided to be disciplined and pick up life’s challenges.</strong
          >
          He became a different person. He trained hard in the gym, ran around,
          and studied for the ASVAB. His third attempt to pass it was a
          successful one. <strong>This allowed him to enter the army.</strong>
        </p>
        <h3 class="transformation__subtitle section-subtitle">Career</h3>
        <p class="transformation__paragraph article-paragraph">
          David started his military training, where he was exceptionally good
          in sit-ups, push-ups, running, but swimming was his Achilles’ heel. He
          felt relieved as the doctors discovered Sickle Cell Anemia, because of
          this Goggins stopped the training. After a while, the medical team
          reversed the decision. David could join the program again, but he
          would have had to start all over again.
          <strong
            >Future warrior still had a quitting mentality and decided not to go
            back.</strong
          >
          After that he moved to Fort Campbell, Kentucky and served working with
          air jets.
          <strong
            >He was upset with his decision and ran away into weight training
            and eating.</strong
          >
          That is how he grew to <em>300 pounds</em> (136 kg). After 4 years in
          the army Goggins became a rat exterminator – a job which is not
          respected in society.
        </p>
        <h3 class="transformation__subtitle section-subtitle">
          Joining Navy Seals
        </h3>
        <p class="transformation__paragraph article-paragraph">
          He lived that kind of life, when one day he saw a TV program with Navy
          Seals. At that moment David felt bad about his job and environment.
          <strong
            >He wanted a change and saw a chance to achieve this by joining the
            special operations unit.</strong
          >
          There was a problem. <em>Big problem</em>.
          <strong>David had to lose 106 pounds (48 kg)</strong> to join the Navy
          Seals program. First, he had to start with cycling. He could not run
          because of his weight. Overall, he did at least swimming,
          weightlifting, biking, and after losing weight running. He got this,
          but still there was an educational barrier. He had to pass the ASVAB
          test again. For Navy Seals he needed a better score than before. After
          solid studying he did it as well.
          <strong>This <em>crazy</em> transformation was done.</strong> He could
          enter one of the best if not the best special operations units in the
          world.

          This training is not a joke. The 6-month program is divided into 3
          phases: physical training, dive training and land warfare. The first
          phase only <em>~20 %</em> of people pass. Maybe because this phase
          consists of the famous

          During Hell Week potential future Seals are exposed to chilly water to
          the extent that there are doctors who do hypothermia checks. They also
          run on sand with boats or logs and do other draining physical
          exercises.
          <strong

        <h3 class="badass__subtitle section-subtitle">San Diego One</h3>
        <p class="badass__paragraph article-paragraph">
          One day David decided to look for the toughest races and he found
          Badwater 135. In this event runners must beat 135 miles in one of the
          harshest places on earth – Death Valley. Goggins contacted the
          organizer but to join he needed to have run experience. Future ultra
          marathon runner did not give up. He decided to participate in an
          ultra-running event – San Diego One Day. In this event runners have 24
          hours to run/walk for as long distance as they can. Goggins started
          having a fast tempo but after a while problems occurred.
          <strong>David ran 70 miles (~112 km)</strong>
          <em>without preparation</em> and the previous day he had a serious
          weight training with his friend from the army. His body was in such a
          bad condition that he
          <em>involuntarily defecated on the chair</em> that he was sitting on.
          Despite that he chose to go back to the race.
          <strong>In pain he managed to get missing 30 miles.</strong>

          <p class="badass__paragraph article-paragraph">
            After this event David
            <strong>discovered a new potential</strong> in him. He knew that he
            could do far more than he thought he can. This is one of his rules -
            <strong
              >if you think you are done then you achieved only 40 % of your
              potential at that moment</strong

            races as:
            <strong
              >HURT 100, MOAB 240 and the previously mentioned BADWATER
              135.</strong

              it.</strong
            >
            He did not stop at just running. He participated in triathlons and
            broke the record of pull ups done in 24 hours. He is a versatile
            athlete who achieves those victories because of his
            <em>warrior mindset</em>.

        <p class="conclusion__paragraph article-paragraph">
          I admire David Goggins’ attitude toward struggle. He is a hero, who
          shows that radical change in life is possible. He is an example to
          many young men for whom it seems <em>not ok</em> to follow today’s
          voices praising mediocrity. I try to choose a harder path because of
          him like many other individuals. Although Goggins achieved those
          things, which I wrote about, a long time ago he is still active, and
          you can get motivated by seeing his struggle on Instagram. Although I
          do not think he is a perfect man, for sure one of the bad traits is
          swearing, you can gain a lot of good things from reading to his story
          and implementing some of his strategies written in one of his books -
          “Can’t Hurt Me. Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds.”, which I
          <em>really</em> recommend.
